    "# Perceptual Decision Making Task\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment implements a two-alternative forced choice perceptual decision-making task, where the agent must integrate noisy sensory evidence over time to make accurate decisions. The task is based on classic motion discrimination experiments ([Britten et al. 1992](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/12/12/4745)) and has been adapted for studying neural mechanisms of decision-making in computational models. The key features of the task are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On each trial, a noisy stimulus appears on either the left or right side of the visual field with varying coherence levels (evidence strength).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choices are represented as angles evenly spaced around a circle. With the default of 2 choices (`dim_ring=2`), this corresponds to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Position 1: 0° (left choice)\n",
    "   - Position 2: 180° (right choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The stimulus is presented as a cosine modulation with additive Gaussian noise, requiring the agent to integrate evidence over time to overcome noise and make accurate decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The agent can respond at any time after stimulus onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The environment includes blocks where one side is more likely than the other, and augments observations with previous actions and rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train an agent on the task using reinforcement learning with [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "2. Analyze the agent's psychometric curves and compare performance across different coherence levels and block contexts.\n"

    "\n",
    "Let's now create and explore the environment using the `PerceptualDecisionMaking` class from neurogym. We'll use the default configuration which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dim_ring = 2`: Two possible choices (left/right) represented at 0° and 180°. Note that the ring architecture can support any number of choices, making it suitable for more complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "- `timing = {'fixation': ~600, 'stimulus': 2000, 'delay': 0, 'decision': 100}` (in milliseconds).\n",
    "- `rewards = {'abort': -0.1, 'correct': +1.0, 'fail': 0.0}`; abort is a penalty applied when the agent fails to fixate. The task allows the trial to be aborted if fixation does not occur, which is where the name of this penalty comes from.\n",
    "- `sigma = 1.0`: Standard deviation of the noise added to the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, several wrappers are used to modify the environment's behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ReactionTime` wrapper allows the agent to respond at any time after stimulus onset.\n",
    "- `SideBias` wrapper introduces blocks where one side is more likely than the other. It uses two key parameters:\n",
    "  - `probs = [[0.2, 0.8], [0.8, 0.2]]`: Probability matrices defining the likelihood of each choice (only two choices in this example) in different blocks\n",
    "  - `block_dur = (20, 100)`: Block duration randomly sampled between 20-100 trials, determining how long each bias condition persists\n",
    "- `PassAction` and `PassReward` wrappers augment the observations with the previous step's action and reward, respectively, enabling the agent to use recent history in decision-making.\n"
