    "# Multi-Task Contextual Decision-Making (Yang19 Cognitive Tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment implements a suite of 20 context-dependent cognitive tasks inspired by the work of [Yang et al. (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30643294/#:~:text=The%20brain%20has%20the%20ability,task%20representations%2C%20a%20critical%20feature). In these tasks, the agent must flexibly switch between different context rules on each trial, similar in spirit to the classic [context-dependent decision-making](https://neurogym.github.io/neurogym/latest/api/envs/#neurogym.envs.native.contextdecisionmaking.ContextDecisionMaking) experiment of [Mante et al. (2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12742). The key features of this multi-task environment are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two-Choice Outputs** (`dim_ring=2`): All tasks share a common action space represented as positions on a ring. With `dim_ring = 2`, there are two choice outputs located at 0° and 180° on this ring (interpreted as \"left\" and \"right\" choices, respectively). The agent's goal on each trial is to select the correct one of these two outputs.\n",
    "2. **Stimulus Inputs with Modality-Specific Evidence**: Each task provides sensory evidence (stimuli) that may come from one or two modalities. The stimuli are often encoded via a cosine-tuned input bump centered on one of the choice positions, with its amplitude representing the evidence strength. For example, a stimulus favoring the left choice might produce an activity peak at 0° on the input ring.\n",
    "3. **Randomized Ground-Truth Choices**: The correct choice (ground truth) is randomized on each trial (for two choices: left or right). This means on some trials left is the correct answer, and on others right is correct, preventing the agent from biasing toward one action.\n",
    "4. **Variable Difficulty Evidence**: The strength of the stimulus evidence (e.g., coherence level in a motion stimulus) is also randomly sampled each trial. Sometimes the evidence strongly favors one choice, and other times it is weak or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of 20 tasks exercises various cognitive skills, including working memory (e.g., remembering stimuli across a delay in matching tasks), perceptual decision-making (integrating noisy sensory evidence over time), rule-based categorization, and inhibitory control (suppressing or initiating actions under certain rules). All tasks are implemented in a consistent format so that a single neural network agent can learn them together via supervised training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train an agent on the 20-task suite using supervised learning. We will generate trial data from the environment and train a recurrent neural network to predict the correct choices.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the agent's performance and behavior across tasks. After training, we will examine how well the agent learned each of the 20 tasks and whether it can flexibly switch contexts from trial to trial.\n"
