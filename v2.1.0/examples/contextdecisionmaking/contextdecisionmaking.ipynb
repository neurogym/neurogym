    "# Context-Dependent Decision Making Task\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment implements a context-dependent perceptual decision-making task, in which the agent has to perform a perceptual decision that depends on a context that is explicitly indicated on each trial. The environment is a simplified version of the original task ([Mante et al. 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12742)), that tests the agents' ability to flexibly switch between different contexts by making them choose between two options (left or right) based on the stimulus evidence associated with the relevant context (e.g., motion and color). The key features of the task are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The relevant context is explicitly signaled on each trial.\n",
    "2. Choices are represented as angles evenly spaced around a circle. Note that the number of choices can be configured via `dim_ring`. With the default of 2 choices, this corresponds to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Position 1: 0° (left choice)\n",
    "   - Position 2: 180° (right choice)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stimulus for each context is represented as a cosine modulation peaked at one of these positions.\n",
    "4. The correct choice (ground truth) is randomly chosen on each trials (for 2 choices: left or right).\n",
    "5. The stimulus evidence (coherence) of each context is also randomly chosen on each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the context signal indicates modality 0, the agent must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose position 1 (left) when context 0's coherence peaks at 0°\n",
    "- Choose position 2 (right) when context 0's coherence peaks at 180°\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",

    "1. Train an agent on the task using supervised learning and reinforcement learning with [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/).\n",
