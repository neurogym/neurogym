class SideBias(TrialWrapper):
    """Changes the probability of ground truth with block-wise biases.

    Args:
        env: The task environment to wrap (must expose `choices`).
        probs: Explicit probability matrix with shape (n_blocks, n_choices).
               Each row defines the choice probabilities for one block and must sum to 1.0.
               The number of columns (n_choices) must match the number of choices defined in the task
               (i.e., `len(env.choices)`), so that each probability maps to a valid choice.
        block_dur: Duration of each block, with behavior depending on the type:
            - int (â‰¥ 1): Use a fixed number of trials per block
                (e.g., block_dur=20 means each block has exactly 20 trials).
            - float (0 < value < 1): Specify a per-trial probability of switching
                to a new block (e.g., block_dur=0.1 means there's a 10% chance of
                switching blocks after each trial).
            - tuple (low, high): Draw the number of trials per block randomly from
                a uniform distribution over the integer range [low, high] (inclusive).

    Examples:
        - probs=[[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8], [0.4, 0.6]], block_dur=200
          Stay 200 trials per block, randomly switch to new block after;
        - probs=[[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8], [0.4, 0.6]], block_dur=0.1
          10% probability per trial to switch to new random block;
        - probs=[[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8], [0.4, 0.6]], block_dur=(200, 400)
          Random trials in [200, 400] range per block, then switch.
